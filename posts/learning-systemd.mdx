As I occasionally write services for daemon processes, every time when I need I just google for it, this works most of the time. But sometimes it repeated and I haven't keep a note of those one off(I wrongly thought) services. Recently read the blog [systemd by examples] which encourage me to write down my services and share here, most usefully hope I can copy them once needed, from here.

- Check status or info of a unit don't need sudo
- A name default indicate to service, e.g. `systemctl status docker` for docker, `systemctl status docker.socket` for docker socket

## Notes from the book

> In systemd, a target is a unit that groups together other systemd units for a particular purpose. The units that a target can group together include services, paths, mount points, sockets, and even other targets.

## Examples

### Jenkins agent for SharedCloud

```ini
# TBC
```

### v2ray

Copied from archlinux wiki, [V2Ray service]

```ini
[Unit]
Description=V2Ray Service
After=network.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
User=nobody
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
ExecStart=/usr/bin/v2ray -confdir /etc/v2ray/

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### iptables save and restore

Copied from [iptables-restore.service] of awslabs/amazon-eks-ami, modified with adding `ExecStartPre`, my iptables file have some custom value need to be replaced for the current running machine, i.e. IP address.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Restore iptables
# iptables-restore must start after docker because docker will
# reconfigure iptables to drop forwarded packets.
After=docker.service network.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStartPre=/bin/bash /etc/sysconfig/replace_ip_in_iptables.sh
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/sysconfig/iptables"
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/mount /data

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```shell
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/sed -i "s/MY_IP/$(hostname -I|cut -d' ' -f2)/g" /etc/sysconfig/iptables
```

### code-server

This file come from the builtin [code-server@.service], a good example for service to start on behalf of a particular user.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=code-server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=exec
ExecStart=/usr/bin/code-server
Restart=always
User=%i

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

## timer

> Not having the [Install] section makes this a static type of service that you can't enable. 


```shell
systemctl list-unit-files -t timer
systemctl list-timers
```

## systemctl cheatsheet

```shell
man systemd.directives
man systemd.unit

systemctl --state=help
systemctl list-units -t service
systemctl list-unit-files
systemctl list-unit-files -t
systemctl is-enabled docker
systemctl is-active docker
systemctl show
systemctl show --property=Virtualization

systemctl list-dependencies
systemctl list-dependencies --after network.target
systemd-analyze dot graphical.target

systemctl get-default
ls -ltr /lib/systemd/system/default.target

# This will shut down the graphics server and bring you back to a text-mode login prompt
sudo systemctl isolate multi-user
sudo systemctl isolate graphical
```
