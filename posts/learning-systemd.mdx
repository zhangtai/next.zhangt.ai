As I occasionally write services for daemon processes, every time when I need I just google for it, this works most of the time. But sometimes it repeated and I haven't keep a note of those one off(I wrongly thought) services. Recently read the blog [systemd by examples] which encourage me to write down my services and share here, most usefully hope I can copy them once needed, from here.

## Examples

### Jenkins agent for SharedCloud

```ini
# TBC
```

### v2ray

```ini
# TBC
```

### iptables save and restore

```ini
# TBC
```
