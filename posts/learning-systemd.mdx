As I occasionally write services for daemon processes, every time when I need I just google for it, this works most of the time. But sometimes it repeated and I haven't keep a note of those one off(I wrongly thought) services. Recently read the blog [systemd by examples] which encourage me to write down my services and share here, most usefully hope I can copy them once needed, from here.

## Examples

### Jenkins agent for SharedCloud

```ini
# TBC
```

### v2ray

Copied from archlinux wiki, [V2Ray service]

```ini
[Unit]
Description=V2Ray Service
After=network.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
User=nobody
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
ExecStart=/usr/bin/v2ray -confdir /etc/v2ray/

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### iptables save and restore

Copied from [iptables-restore.service] of awslabs/amazon-eks-ami

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Restore iptables
# iptables-restore must start after docker because docker will
# reconfigure iptables to drop forwarded packets.
After=docker.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "/sbin/iptables-restore < /etc/sysconfig/iptables"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### code-server

This file come from the builtin [code-server@.service], a good example for service to start on behalf of a particular user.

```ini
[Unit]
Description=code-server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=exec
ExecStart=/usr/bin/code-server
Restart=always
User=%i

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

## systemctl cheatsheet

```shell
man systemd.directives
man systemd.unit

systemctl --state=help
systemctl list-units -t service
systemctl list-unit-files
systemctl list-unit-files -t
systemctl is-enabled docker
systemctl is-active docker
systemctl show
systemctl show --property=Virtualization
```
