I used to setup my homelab kubernetes cluster with [Rancher] and [rke], both are products of Rancher. Honestly I haven't spent too much time on both. Until recently I want to setup kubernetes cluster, again. So I goto Rancher's website found that they have another product: RKE2.

It's easy to setup just follow the official guide.
