I used to setup my homelab kubernetes cluster with [Rancher] and [rke], both are products of Rancher. Honestly I haven't spent too much time on both. Until recently I want to setup kubernetes cluster, again. So I goto Rancher's website found that they have another product: RKE2.

It's easy to setup just follow the [RKE2 official installation guide]. Here is summary of my installtion manually, I opened a tmux session with 4 panes, one for server, 3 for agents. Each has 4 cores, 8GB RAM 160GB storage, they are VMs running on a host of ESXi instance.
