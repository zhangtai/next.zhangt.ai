In this post I will show you how to expose the homelab services through HAPROXY as a reversed proxy, but keep in mind this is dangerous because anyone knows the domains you setup will be able to connect your homelab directly, and if you not securely setup your firewall they can be possibly hack you and your families devices.

## Prerequisites

- A domain, the provider supports wildcard domains(I use cloudflare)
- Wildcard TLS cert and privkey
- Public IP address provided by your ISP
- OpnSense with os-ddclient and os-haproxy plugins installed

## Setups

### Dynamic DNS

As a home internet service, ISP will only provide dynamic IP(At least in China), so you need to setup ddns service to update the IP address when changing.

Go to `Services / Dynamic DNS / Settings` create one with inputs:

- Service: `Cloudflare`
- Username: `<email>`
- Password: `<Cloudflare Global Token>`
- zone: `<e.g. example.com>`
- Hostnames: `<*.example.com>`
- Check ip method: `Interface`
- Force SSL: `true`
- Interface to monitor: `WAN`

### Wildcard TLS certificate and Private key

I use certbot to create an rotate my certs, after the certs created upload to the OpnSense system in: `System / Trust / Certificates`

### Port Forward

You will need to select a primary port for all the services(e.g. 1234), this will be listen by a frontend service. For a simple homelab with not to much and complex services one public service is able to serve all the services. In this post I will create only one.

You may need to create an alias of the custom port in `Firewall / Aliases`, if you are not using standard HTTPS port for exposing, because some ISP not allowing opening 80 or 443 port.

Go to `Firewall / NAT / Port Forward` and create a new rule as:

- Interface: `WAN`
- Protocol: `TCP`
- Destination: `WAN net`
- Destination port range: `<Port_Alias>`
- Redirect target IP: `<OPNSENSE_LAN_IP_Alias>`
- Redirect target port: `<Port_Alias>`
- NAT reflection: `Enable`

You will also need to set `Firewall / Settings / Advanced` on below field to enable NAT reflection:

- Reflection for port forwards: `true`
- Automatic outbound NAT for Reflection: `true`

### HAProxy

The sequence for setup each service in HAProxy is this chart, each service has very detailed explanation in the configuration page.

    rs1[Real Server 1] --> bp1[Backend Pools 1]
    bp1 --> con1[Conditions 1]
    con1 --> ru1[Rules 1]
    rs2[Real Server 2] --> bp2[Backend Pools 2]
    bp2 --> con2[Conditions 2]
    con2 --> ru2[Rules 2]
    rsn[Real Server n] --> bpn[Backend Pools n]
    bpn --> conn[Conditions n]
    conn --> run[Rules n]
    ru1 --> ps[Public Services]
    ru2 --> ps
    run --> ps
    `}
/>

I will show an example to expose code-server service with port `8080` on a local machine with ip `192.168.1.2`

#### Real Server

- Name or Prefix: `CODE-SERVER`
- FQDN or IP: `192.168.1.2`
- Port: `8080`
- SSL: According to your servcie

#### Backend Pool

- Name: `CODE-SERVER`
- Servers: `CODE-SERVER`

#### Condition

- Name: `CODE-SERVER`
- Condition type: `<Host starts with>` (Select depends on your real needs)
- Host Prefix: `code-server.example.com`

#### Rule

- Name: `CODE-SERVER`
- Select conditions: `CODE-SERVER`
- Use backend pool: `CODE-SERVER`

#### Public Service

As said, you will only create one public service

- Name: `<e.g. homelab>`
- Listen Addresses: `0.0.0.0:<Your_Port>`
- Default Backend Pool: `none`
- Enable SSL offloading: true
- Certificates: `<The one created earlier>`
- Default certificate: `<Same as Certificates>`
- Enable HTTP/2: true
- Rules: `<Select in the dropdown>`
