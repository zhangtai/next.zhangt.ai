I had previously committed some images into my blog git repository, but recently found that I can't keep adding blog images into the repo, which will cause it bloat.

## Convert images to webp

As all major target of this blog should have visiting with the browser supports webp, so I will convert all non-svg images into webp. I have write a python script to convert all png files to webp, which using [Wand] library, although I can also use ImageMagick directly, but considering later will also use the script to upload to GCS so I decided to use Python, because it more modern, confident and easy for writing test cases.

The ratio of convert, 10 to 20 times small in size!

```bash session
(P)☁  images [main] ls -l *png
-rw-r--r--@ 1 taizhang  staff  455183 Mar 26 15:15 casual-life-3d-green-book-with-orange-ribbon.png
-rw-r--r--@ 1 taizhang  staff  414112 Mar 26 15:14 casual-life-3d-lab.png
-rw-r--r--@ 1 taizhang  staff  444124 Mar 26 15:13 casual-life-3d-young-man-and-woman-standing-together.png

(P)☁  images [main] ls -l *webp
-rw-r--r--  1 taizhang  staff  21920 Apr 24 09:36 casual-life-3d-green-book-with-orange-ribbon.webp
-rw-r--r--  1 taizhang  staff  42284 Apr 24 09:36 casual-life-3d-lab.webp
-rw-r--r--  1 taizhang  staff  46594 Apr 24 09:36 casual-life-3d-young-man-and-woman-standing-together.webp
```

## Upload to GCS

- Upload with file browser
- Upload with `gsutil`
- Upload with python client library

## Delete images in the repository's commitments with bfg

I need to delete the images already in the repo, which is useless and adding extra large size to the repo. I used [bfg].

Result: From `3.7MB` to `356KB`, another 10 times shrink.

```bash session
(P)nodejs/zhangt.ai [ bfg -D casual-life-3d-lab.png                                                                                main ] 9:26 AM
